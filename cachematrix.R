## Caching the inverse of a matrix
## 

## Creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
